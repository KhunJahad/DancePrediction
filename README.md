# DancePrediction
This is my solution on Dance Prediction problem of Hacker-earth Deep Learning Challenge. 


Firstly I augmented the data in Data Preparation jupyter notebook . Then I fine tuned a pre-trained model to get a train accuracy of 98% and validation accuracy of 96%. I obtained 67% accuracy on the online score ..  This Project will be updated as we improve the accuracy. Any type of suggestions are welcomed and I m just a beginner..
